This Python Alarm Clock application is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the Pygame mixer module to handle audio playback. It allows the user to set an alarm time in 24-hour format and choose a custom alarm tone in `.mp3` or `.wav` format using a file dialog. Once the alarm is set, a separate background thread starts and continuously checks the current time against the user-defined alarm time. When the current time matches the alarm time, the selected audio tone is played in a loop, and a popup window appears with "Snooze" and "Stop" options.

If the user chooses to snooze, the alarm will stop and automatically reset to ring again after the specified snooze duration, which by default is 5 minutes but can be customized through the interface. If the user selects "Stop", the alarm will stop and the thread will terminate. The application includes input validation to ensure the time is entered correctly and that an audio file is selected. Overall, it provides a simple and interactive interface where users can easily manage alarm settings, control the alarm sound, and personalize the snooze duration, all while keeping the main application responsive through the use of threading.
